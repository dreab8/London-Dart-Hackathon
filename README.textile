h1. This is the dart code part used by the chrome extention you can find in the Luigi Agosti repository:

The aim of the extention is to help dart developers in the discovery of the api.

h2. How to install it?

Get chrome ... and go here

h2. How to use it?

In the search bar type "dart" and then press space. After that as you type you will see the suggestions filled with stuff from the Dart api reference.

h2. Important notes and Thanks

This has been developed on the idea of Roman Nurik extension "Android SDK Reference Search".

All the code has been developed and tested during the London Dart Hackathon 2012.

The general idea was to use as much as possible dart code for the extension and use javascript only for the interface layer to chrome.

We are happy to receive feedback, changes or see the code used for other open source projects.
